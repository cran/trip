	CHANGES IN trip VERSION 1.1-6

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS


	 o Thanks to Adrian Baddeley for updates to pixellate.psp in
	 spatstat 1.18-3 and 1.18-4.

	 o Thanks to Edzer Pebesma for updates to the CVS development
	 version of sp, methods for split and SpatialPixelsDataFrame.


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES



	o New function trip.split.exact to cut trip events at specific
	time-based boundaries.

	o Added method argument, including density and pixellate to
	 tripGrid, using density.psp and pixellate.psp.


	 o trip.R: updated tripGrid, replaced old interpolation
	approximation with spatstat exact line/cross/cell logic
	(pixellate.psp). Zero length line segments are supported by
	trip, and their contribution is recorded by point in cell
	measurement.  tripGrid.interp still exists for the old
	approach, and kde method.

	o added verbose argument to readArgos to suppress reporting of
	duplicate time modifications.

	o added summary of trip duration total to print.summary.tordata. 

BUG FIXES
	o improvements to makeGridTopology which would sometimes give a silly result

	o removed boilerplate tags in many Rd files

	o removed unused \dots argument in speedfilter

	o trip.R: validtordata required the ID component of a trip to
	be numeric or factor. This now allows character.
	
	o trip.R: updated setMethod("[", "trip" to use same argument
	handling as SpatialPointsDataFrame

	o Fixed harmless warning error in readArgos for longitudes > 180.


	CHANGES IN trip VERSION 1.1-4

	o trip.R: removed setReplaceMethod required by r50609 in R-devel.
